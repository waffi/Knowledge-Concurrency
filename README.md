## What is Thread?
Thread is a unit of a process that is responsible for executing the application code. 

By default, every process has at least one thread which is responsible for executing the application code and that thread is called as Main Thread. So, every application by default is a single-threaded application.

## What is Multithreading?

A process can have multiple threads and each thread can perform a different task. In simple words, we can say that the three methods we define in our program can be executed by three different threads. 
The advantage is that the execution takes place simultaneously (at the same time).
